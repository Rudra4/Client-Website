		{"cShort" : "grammer", "cName" : "Grammatical Skill", "content" : "By grammatical skill, we don't mean the ability to remember schoolbook grammar rules. We mean the ability to construct meaningful sentences. It is the ability to construct sentences, not the ability to diagram them, which is necessary for writing. When people say that everyone can write, we suspect that they mean simply that everyone can construct meaningful sentences and record them on paper. Not quite everyone qualifies to this standard, but in the developed world, most people do."},
		{"cShort" : "composition", "cName" : "Compositional Skill", "content" : "Compositional skill is the ability to organize words to produce an effect. Storytelling is a compositional skill. A compelling lecture or blog post displays compositional skill. Isn't compositional skill just an extension of grammatical skill? We don't think so. And indeed, if we consult our own experience, we are sure we will all remember a great raconteur or someone who was wonderful at teaching you how to do something, but who would blanch at the very idea of putting pen to paper."},
		{"cShort" : "domain", "cName" : "Domain Knowledge", "content" : "Many technical writers would vehemently deny that domain knowledge is a component of writing skill. Some even go so far as to suggest that ignorance of the subject domain is an asset, that it allows them to appreciate the perspective of the user. But domain knowledge is important for other reasons than knowledge of the subject matter, as important as that may be. Every decent writer will acknowledge that it is important to know your reader."}
